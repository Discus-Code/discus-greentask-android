This iteration is based on the following idea to make a minimul first completely working version, which
was pretty well received by the entire group:

"Let me bounce an idea off of the group: I was thinking about making a really stripped down first version of the app out of the code I've already written.  maybe: bake in the spreadsheet of tasks rather than worrying about a CMS, use an Android notification instead of a custom alarm, maybe hide the user registration until we think about the back end, and finally maybe strip out the whole idea of "points" for completed tasks.    So what you would be left with is a daily notification of a sustainability task, and the capacity to customize the notification time."
